<h3>maker's note</h3>
hello! this app is the result of my (on-going) quest in learning about and applying virtue ethics to everyday living.
<p>
i've made it mainly for personal use and it's still a wip, so much of it might only make sense / be useful to me. but i've put together a few words below on the inspiration / usage. 
<p> 
i do hope you'll check it out! and maybe find it helpful too ☺
<p>
if you have any thoughts on improvement / further development, feel free to send them to lois.lee@me.com

<h3> what is virtue ethics?</h3>
<strong>virtue ethics</strong> is an approach of moral reasoning that focuses on the changes choices produce in the individual making them.
<p>
rather than stressing duties / rules or consequences of actions, virtue ethics emphasises the character and virtue of an individual.
<p>
the central question is not "is this action right or wrong?" but "by thinking this way, making these choices and doing these things, is this <em>the kind of</em> person i want to be?"
<p>
for Aristotle, living well is synonymous with being a good person -- a person striving for excellence, striving towards the good -- a human being fully alive.    
<p>
excellence, here, is the Greek term, arête (ἀρετή), also translated as virtue. 
<p>
to be a virtuous person, a person who has and displays arête, is to be <em>the kind of </em> person who consistently chooses the right acts for the right motives -- <em>the kind of</em> person who would notice, expect, value, feel, desire, choose, act, and react in a way that is <em>most beautiful</em>. 
<p>
we know of people, whether in history or in our lives, who embody and exemplify just that. he or she not only <em>has</em> kindness, compassion, patience, generosity, astuteness, prudence, integrity, critical thinking, humility, etc. but also <em>is</em> those too. 
<p>
they have a consistent, beautiful quality about them. they radiate goodness. you know you can trust them. 
<p>
... and we want that for ourselves, too. (i know i do!) because, what else is worth striving for?

<hr>

<h3>what is kharassō?</h3>
the name of the app is the Greek verb kharassō (χαράσσω) meaning 'i etch, engrave, stamp, sharpen.' 
<p>
it is the word from which kharaktēr (χαρακτήρ, “type, nature, character”) is derived.
<p> 
our character is something “etched into” us, shaped and reshaped continually by the intentions we deliberate and small choices and practices we make and do, and our reflection on those actions.
<p>
we attain virtues, in short, through practicing them.

<hr>

<h3>how to use this</h3>
the idea is that at the start of every week, you reflect on your past week and add to your upcoming week a few (3 is a good number to start with) small, concrete practices that will help you grow in virtue and freer from vice. 
<p>
there are already some pre-loaded on the practices-index page and you can add new ones. 
<p>
the practices are organised according to the intentions behind them. the categories are: i want to better live, i want to better love myself, i want to better love my family, friends and neighbours, i want to better love my enemies, i want to better care for creation and our common home. 
<p>
often times, we forget or confuse why we do things. for example, we forget that we are exercising or eating less of certain foods because we want to better take care of our bodies and better love ourselves, and instead adopt an attitude of self-criticism and self-hate. 
<p> 
how radically different those approaches are! especially in the long-run. 
<p> 
that's why, for the weeks page, each practice is accompanied by the reason so that we can be reminded of our intentions to better love and will the good of ourselves and others.  
<p>
if you're having trouble with coming up with small actionable steps, consider the things that you find yourself mindlessly doing or addicted to. you can commit to resisting the urge to do those things. and be sure to add a counter-practice! 
<p>
so, for example: 
<p>
'limiting my social media feed-scroll to cumulatively fifteen minutes a day' 
<p>
&& instead, should i feel the compulsion to open those sites/apps, i'll be: 
<p>
'reading a paragraph of an awesome book that's on my library app'
<p>
or 'straightening my posture and stetching my arms and neck'
